  bio: |
    I founded and run Unboxed Consulting, an Agile Enterprise Ruby on Rails System Integrator. I enjoy stimulating ideas, shaping the company and looking for ways to improve ourselves. I am also interested in Lean Startup and Startup Weekends.
    In my spare time I am setting up a charity for pupils to attend Hilton College.
    I was named 'Best Agile Coach or Mentor (Process)' at the 2014 UK Agile Awards.

    As a contributor to Ruby on Rails since 2007 and a core team member since 2012 I really enjoy helping people with their Rails problems and working at Unboxed gives me a great opportunity to do that, both with the great developers we have here and with our clients.
    I also like to help to the new generation of Rails programmers and as part of that I mentor students from across the world as part of the Facebook OpenAcademy and Google Summer of Code programs.

    There’s only so much a developer can do on his own, even when supplied with a bottomless cup of Darjeeling and all the Scottish indie-pop his ears desire. At least, that’s what I’ve learned in my years as a web developer and why I joined Unboxed Consulting. It’s a great team of smart people with an amazing focus on an Agile development process that I’m glad to be a part of.

    I connect Unboxed with the big wide world and help the business grow. I'm an ideas factory and I love digital products, information design, lean start up and 'making stuff'.
    My other love is running - track and cross country. Some people say I have too much energy. It's possible...

    I have been interested in web design/development since the start of high school where I created a personal website. This was used to host numerous Photoshop tutorials and other content that I had created. Following this success I have been producing portfolio websites for small local companies and ever since I have been eager to develop this passion further. This has been made possible by joining Unboxed Consulting.

    I set the bar high for myself and am always satisfied with the results of hard focused work. I find myself exploring new areas of design all the time and I pay a tremendous amount of attention to detail.
    After learning how the Unboxed team work, I knew I’d fit right in.
    In my free time I enjoy writing music.
    When the evening approaches I make sure I’m cooking up a great meal
