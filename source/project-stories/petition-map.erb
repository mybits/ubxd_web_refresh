about:
  title: "A petition heat map of the UK"
  content: "Petition Map is an interactive heat map, which allows users to visualise signatures of a UK petition on a real-time map of the United Kingdom. Following the redevelopment of the Parliament Petitions platform with Government Digital Service (GDS), Cale (our intern developer) took innovation time to explore, develop and build this visual heat map to support the Petitions platform for members of the public."

open_source:
  title: "Open source-powered system"
  content: "Calling on the open source data of the Parliament Petitions database, Petition Map pulls the JSON data of each individual petition, allowing users to select from a list of active petitions to visualise, and Javascript library D3 is used to create the interactive aspect. Each time a petition is loaded, the set of signatures is calculated relative to the number of signatures for that specific petition, this is then used to colour the map."
