partnership:
  title: "Offshoring partnership between Contiki and Unboxed"
  results:
    - "The site rebuild for the global tour operator's aging platform resulted in a significant increase in bookings"
    - "Results: page sessions up by 7%, page views up by 28% and conversion rates up by 43% over the previous period"
    - "Fully responsive design and a microservice architecture ready for the future"

introduction:
  title: "Breathing life into a 10-year-old platform"
  content: "Contiki Holidays is a worldwide travel operation, specialising in trips for the 18-35 age demographic and booking over 150,000 departures per year. In an increasingly saturated market targeting a tech-savvy demographic, Contiki decided to revamp their web-based travel agent portal. The objectives focused on the site’s user experience (UX) through to the visitor-to-sale conversion. The pressure was on to build something special as the site was already 10 years old and in need of a revamp to bring it in line with the times and ensure relevance and ease of use for Contiki’s trade partners."

statistics_title: "Contiki in numbers"
statistics:
  - "78% the increased likelihood of users willing to book online"
  - "43% online conversion rate increase from previous period"
  - "47% how much online trade bookings are up on the previous period"

agile:
  title: "Agile: the key in shift to iterative customer-led design development"
  content: "Our Cape Town team partnership agreed that an Agile way of working would meet the ‘design-led’ needs of Contiki. It can be a project stumbling block when teams are used to ‘pixel perfect’ work to sign off, dragging out delivery times. Making decisions early on about how to overcome this was critical to the project’s success. The core project team consisted of four developers, a Scrum Master, Contiki’s design team and the Product Owner. The team had a 4-week wireframing and prototyping stage, before moving onto the actual build, which took 12 weeks."

project_quote:
  quote: "The project was completed on time and on budget. Can’t ask for more than that!"
  source: "Simon Larkin, Product Owner, Contiki"

collaboration:
  title: "Offshore team collaboration delivering step change in site performance"
  content: "With outstanding design cited as one of the project’s key deliverables, the wireframe was completed. The development and design teams worked side-by-side and communicated with efficiency and transparency to ensure a speedy initial site build. Built in our preferred content-driven, mobile-first approach, this is a site created to meet Contiki’s future business goals. It was also the first test of the newly developed Contiki product API, developed in Ruby on Rails. Working in the ‘Unboxed Way’ ensured frequent, high-bandwidth, clear and open channels of communication. Components were delivered weekly with transparent progress against deadlines, and Contiki were able to re-prioritise their features on a weekly basis as new requirements emerged."

release_quote:
  quote: "We had a straightforward and smooth production release with minimal fuss and no user support issues to finish the project off."
  source: "Simon Larkin, Contiki"

objectives:
  title: "Pre-project objectives met and exceeded"
  content: "With the new launched live site, the project’s pre-set objectives have all been met or exceeded. Page loading times have decreased on average by 56%, conversion rates have gone up by 43% and bookings made on the new site are up 47%. Seventy-five percent of users also rated a positive improvement on their previous experience on the site. Furthermore, technologies that were employed will dramatically cut the cost of any future improvements. The ‘Unboxed Way’ made the idea of successful offshoring development a reality for Contiki – a fully-integrated team with the capabilities to adapt to meet the design-led needs of the project."
