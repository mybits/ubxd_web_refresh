## Stop sleeping in your tests - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

https://github.com/schneems/wait_for_it

We often see in tests a `sleep(10)` or something like it to make the suite pause whilst a process boots, an AJAX call happens, etc. and since the CI server often runs slower than your development machine you add a couple of extra seconds to reduce intermittent test failures. Now the new wait_for_it gem from Richard Schneeman at Heroku means you don't have to slow down your test suite unnecessarily waiting for processes to finish - just wrap the dependent code in a block passed to `WaitForIt.new` and delete those `sleep` calls.

## Web Development: Keep It Simple - [Anson K](/people#anson-kelly)

https://medium.com/@wob/the-sad-state-of-web-development-1603a861d29f

Angry man post lampooning what Node.js + javascript frameworks (aka SPA's) have done to modern websites. Behind the ridicule is a message to web developers to keep things lean, mean and use the simplest tool to get the job done
