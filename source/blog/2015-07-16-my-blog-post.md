## A New Post

Enter text in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Use the toolbar above, or click the **?** button for formatting help.

**Not too sure what this does**

Just enters it in and not places you in the correct area :(


Would also need custom README  for GitHub flavoured markdown :smiley:
