## How to use the first £50k of a digital product to build the business case for the next £500k

You’ve been given the first initial budget for a new digital product idea (or to overhaul an existing one). That digital product is going to be the one that makes a real impact. But how do you prove the concept for this large, new digital product and unlock a full budget, with **just** the _first_ signed-off £50k… Especially when you’re using Agile…?

This is the great challenge we aimed to overcome at our session on the 30th November 2015, uncovering the techniques to getting full buy-in from the person holding the purse strings, and unlocking that full budget. We heard from those who have been faced with this exact challenge in large organisations, in both the public and private sector:
 
- Melissa Sabella, Director of Product and Innovation - Reed Learning
- Richard Atherton, Management Consultant, Coach & Programme Manager
- Martyn Evans, Head of Product - Unboxed
- Dr. Gillian Holdsworth, Programme Director – SH:24 (the online service in partnership with the NHS)

## Talk 2: How do you make projects work in an agile context?

Stakeholders can get hooked on the condition of certainty. Go on a journey with them and try to reduce the dosage of certainty. Try to take away the illusion of certainty in a way that’s respectful and meets them where they’re at. The game is to try and give them a soft landing - to protect them and to protect you.
 
###It’s more about stakeholder one-to-one
Break down what you’re doing into smaller chunks, from a budget perspective. In terms of building trust, in having the stakeholder allowing you to spend a small amount of money, rather than give them lots of detail on how you’re going to spend the big pot of money, it’s more about the one-to-one with the stakeholders. Those who are ultimately giving the approval for the funds.
 
###Communicate the value
How do you communicate the value of the money you’re spending? It’s less about how you communicate value and more about how you make your stakeholders feel something. How do you make you stakeholders feel proud? How do you make your stakeholders feel energised? In the same way as when you’re designing software, you think about the user experience. When managing stakeholders, ask the same question – what is the user experience of the stakeholder?
 
###Get stakeholders excited
When it comes to delivering, it’s really about going into the room and thinking less about the spreadsheets, the numbers and the money you’re asking for, but starting upfront with getting stakeholders into the wireframes and having a play, and feel excited and proud of what you’ve all done, as a team. Then the money conversation becomes much easier.

###Set out to prove yourself wrong
 
_“You must not fool yourself, you are the easiest person to fool”_ – Richard Feynman
 
We’ve all got great ideas. But there’s a chance that your idea isn’t very good. Work on that assumption and go out to prove yourself right. It’s the power of negative thinking – we all try to be too positive, but sometimes it’s good to be realistic.
 
### Start somewhere
People spend so much time trying to think of what it is they’re going to do, what the best place to start is, what the first thing to do is. It doesn’t really matter if you’re assuming it’s wrong. So just start somewhere, get cracking and go and find out.
 
### Start with the riskiest thing
Think about what you’re assuming and what you believe. If you’re wrong about this, what is going to be the biggest disaster? Which thing is going to make you fail? Start by tackling that first.
 
Encourage people to tell you stuff that you don’t want to hear
Talk to your customers. It should be one of the first things you do. You want them to validate your idea.

###Assemble a small team of generalists

###Communicate openly and frequently
