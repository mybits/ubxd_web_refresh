## How to use the first £50k of a digital product to build the business case for the next £500k

You’ve been given the first initial budget for a new digital product idea (or to overhaul an existing one). That digital product is going to be the one that makes a real impact. But how do you prove the concept for this large, new digital product and unlock a full budget, with **just** the _first_ signed-off £50k… Especially when you’re using Agile…?

This is the great challenge we aimed to overcome at our session on the 30th November 2015, uncovering the techniques to getting full buy-in from the person holding the purse strings, and unlocking that full budget. We heard from those who have been faced with this exact challenge in large organisations, in both the public and private sector:
 
- Melissa Sabella, Director of Product and Innovation - Reed Learning
- Richard Atherton, Management Consultant, Coach & Programme Manager
- Martyn Evans, Head of Product - Unboxed
- Dr. Gillian Holdsworth, Programme Director – SH:24 (the online service in partnership with the NHS)
