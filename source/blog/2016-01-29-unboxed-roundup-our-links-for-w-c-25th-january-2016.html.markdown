## Postgres Query Plan Visualization - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

http://tatiyants.com/postgres-query-plan-visualization/

Ever wondered what those weird numbers are when you're trying work out why your SQL query performance is so bad and you do "EXPLAIN SELECT ...". Well, wonder no more because Alex Tatiyants has written a Postgres EXPLAIN Visualizer (PEV) that will take the output from the EXPLAIN command and turn it into a human legible diagram so that mere database mortals can see what's happening to their query.

## Thinking about technical debt differently - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://laughingmeme.org/2016/01/10/towards-an-understanding-of-technical-debt/

We talk about technical debt a lot, but there's no clear understanding across our industry of what we mean.  We all know it's something bad, but we can mean lots of differnt things that require different approaches to mitigate or remove.  This article goes into what we really mean when we use those words and explores the different meanings.  The closing paragraph has a really good point too, about not getting too hung up on the choices we make right now:

>  All code is technical debt. All code is, to varying degrees, an incorrect bet on what the future will look like.

So true.
