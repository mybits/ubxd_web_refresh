## Postgres Query Plan Visualization - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

http://tatiyants.com/postgres-query-plan-visualization/

Ever wondered what those weird numbers are when you're trying work out why your SQL query performance is so bad and you do "EXPLAIN SELECT ...".

http://laughingmeme.org/2016/01/10/towards-an-understanding-of-technical-debt/

We talk about technical debt a lot, but there's no clear understanding across our industry of what we mean.

The closing paragraph has a really good point too, about not getting too hung up on the choices we make right now:

>  All code is technical debt. All code is, to varying degrees, an incorrect bet on what the future will look like.

So true.
