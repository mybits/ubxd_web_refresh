## Git Rebase without Tears - [Oskar P](/people#oskar-pearson)

https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/rebase_without_tears.html

I branched 'master' to 'feature-a', then branched 'feature-a' to 'feature-b'.

However, now the 'feature-a' branch has merge conflicts, and rebasing 'feature-b' is becoming a nightmare.

This URL explains the magic of the full rebase command: 'git rebase --onto <graft-point> <exclude-from> <include-from>'.

## `curl | bash` is it good or bad? - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

There's no denying that the `curl | bash` pattern is super convenient for people installing software.  So it's not surprising it's quite as prevalent as it is.  There's plenty of articles out there that describe why you should be wary of installing software this way, and the first article is another of those but this time it describes an interesting exploit.  After reading the first article I don't think I'll be using the pattern to install software from an arbitrary server I've never encountered before, but after reading the second I'm more reassured about it as a pattern from software vendors and servers that I do trust.
