## A conversation about HTTP2 - [Patrick V](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/patrick-vine)

http://www.se-radio.net/2015/07/episode-232-mark-nottingham-on-http2/

An interesting podcast conversation with one of the people involved in making HTTP2 happen.  They talk through some of the history and some of the technical details.  If you know very little about http2 and want to know more, this is a great listen to understand the basics of the whys, the whats and possibly a little about what it might mean to you.
