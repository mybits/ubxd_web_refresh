## A conversation about HTTP2 - [Patrick V](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/patrick-vine)

An interesting podcast conversation with one of the people involved in making HTTP2 happen.  They talk through some of the history and some of the technical details.

Perhaps Iâ€™m a little late to the party but Internet Explorer is slowly being killed off. Announced in August 2014, Microsoft plan to end support for IE8 on 12th January 2016.
