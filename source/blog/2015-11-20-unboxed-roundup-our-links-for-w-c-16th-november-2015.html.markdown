## A conversation about HTTP2 - [Patrick V](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/patrick-vine)

http://www.se-radio.net/2015/07/episode-232-mark-nottingham-on-http2/

An interesting podcast conversation with one of the people involved in making HTTP2 happen.  They talk through some of the history and some of the technical details.  If you know very little about http2 and want to know more, this is a great listen to understand the basics of the whys, the whats and possibly a little about what it might mean to you.

["How 'Bout I Love You More" by Colin MacIntyre aka Mull Historical Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvXHYHyCuM8)

Reminds me of my first weekend at T in the Park in Scotland when I was working in Scotland back when Richard and I first met.
