## Trying out stormboard for remote, distributed team retrospective - [Carrie B](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/carrie-bedingfield)

https://stormboard.com/

How do you run a retrospective with 40 people, all over the UK? One answer is using Stormboard which is pretty handy as far as online whiteboards go. Veerrry nice interface and lots of free functionality of which the most cool is the kanban template which means your post its go on a grid and Stormboard ​_knows where you posted them_​ (how does it KNOW?) and exports them in the right categories (no typing up and order). Also there is voting stickies up/down and index cards and all kinds of other nice things.

[Bran Van 3000 - "Drinking In LA"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQsQZvsR_QI)

This is one of those songs that's been around since I was around 10 that I never got tired of. Forced upon by my older brother, since then it's always been a favourite that stood the test of time.
