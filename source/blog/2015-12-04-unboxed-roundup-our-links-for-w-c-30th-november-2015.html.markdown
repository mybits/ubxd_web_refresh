## What a load of Raspbian Pi... - [Jon N](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/jon-normington)

https://github.com/RPi-Distro/repo/issues/6

... well its not a lie, but if you are running a Raspberry PI with Raspbian OS
and using the default ssh generated host keys generated at boot time, you might
want to regenerate them as soon as possible, as they're likely predictable.

https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=126892

The above raspberry pi forum link describes the problem, and states how to
regenerate them if you haven't already with ssh-keygen.  Its a little
interesting read around /dev/random and how entropy is built,
and lead me onto http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/. Enjoy...
