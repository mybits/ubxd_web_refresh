[Brighton Ruby](http://brightonruby.com/) is unsuprisingly a conference about Ruby based in Brighton, and organised by [@AndyCroll](https://twitter.com/andycroll). Being quite new to both Ruby and to Rails, a Ruby conference seemed like the perfect place to pickup a few tricks of the trade and see what's next for the language and community.

# Talks Worth Talking About
## The Point of Objects / [John Cinnamond](https://twitter.com/jcinnamond)
<!-- - Familiar with OOP, but this talk did a great job of reminding us how we got there and why we should appriciate it more
- Great interactive demos
- Interesting history -->

>*"If procedural programming is so great, why don't I marry it?"*

John talked Object-Orientated Programming as "the art of deffered caring", emphasising that OOP is structured in a way that lets you focus solely on the logic required for a specific task, delegating out required but not strictly relevant logic for later.

This isn't just a concept for the average developer to consider, but paramount to the ease of use of a language. Most modern programming languages are not domain specifc, i.e. the developer and even the high level language should not have to consider the machine that code is running on, as lower level aspects handle machine-specific translations in compilation. John suggested that we have lost out on an even greater computer revolution due to developers caring too much about machine specific solutions.

Going back into the short but fascinating history of computing, John talked about the first computer that was able to store programs in digital memory, opening the door for more user readable representations of data. Created in 1948, "Baby", or the [Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine](http://curation.cs.manchester.ac.uk/computer50/www.computer50.org/mark1/new.baby.html) if you're trying to impress someone, used a cathode ray tube monitor (the same technology used in those massive screens from the 90s) to maintain information on a screen that had to constantly be refreshed to keep data for more than a second. The values on the screen were then used as input/output.

[David Sharp has created a Java-based simulator of Baby](http://www.davidsharp.com/baby/), if you'd like to try it out.

John's point is that many languages still used today (C, namely) are still based on languages that had a very specific design for a bespoke machine architecture, and this can be unhelpful for developing for modern computers. OOP should have nothing to do with the underlying technology. Instead, it should be recognised as a technique for deffering logic to make code more maintainable, readable, and easier to write.

## The Function of Bias / [Sara Simon](https://twitter.com/sarambsimon)
- From english degree to software dev
- Works for public radio that previously was getting a bit antiquated
- Possibility of treated publication like code (e.g. with error checks, and a defined structure)
- IDE for articles?
- Kickstarter for narative IDE

Sara studied creative writing before becoming a developer, and brought her interesting perspectives on the similarities between developing and journalism to the table, particulary the unavoidable effect of bias that permeates both industries.

>*“Whether we steal or we borrow, it’s impossible. Even if you’re telling yourself you’re not stealing, subconsciously you are influenced whether you like it or not.” - Mark Ronson, [How Sampling Transformed Music](http://www.ted.com/talks/mark_ronson_how_sampling_transformed_music "How Sampling Transformed Music - Mark Ronson TED Talk")*

Ronson is talking about the music industry, but Sara points out his reasoning applies to more than that. "We live in the post-sampling era. We take the things that we love and we build on them.” There is a clear parallel to development in this. It's no coincedence that the first way I'd attempt to explain [this absurd idea](http://pooperapp.com/ "Pooper App") is "It's Uber... for dog poo." *We take things we love and we build on them.*

Sara argued that we now have a global awareness that our work is shared and has the power to influence further work, and because of this we have a greater responsibility in software development that we've had before. In journalism, this responsibilty can be seen in the form of the [Code of Ethics](http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp) from the Society of Professional Journalists:

- Seek truth and report it
- Minimize harm
- Act Independently
- Be accountable and transparent

Sara stipulated that we could draw many more people into software development if as an industry we could come to a similar code of conduct, making collaboration and relationships easier, and improving the environment of customers and developers alike.

In addition to the above, she also explored what elements of typical software environments she was also intereseted in applying to journalism. Pairing on reports is a great way to mitigate bias, or more simply to just catch spelling mistakes early. Crowdsourcing journalism could mean
