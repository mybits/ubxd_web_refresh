With ongoing spending cuts and budgets getting tighter and tighter, it’s becoming more costly for local councils to maintain their services as they currently work. Shifting these services to digital reduces running costs, increases accessibility and reduces waiting and processing times. So what steps have to be taken to digitise your major services?<br/>
<br/>

# This event will help you understand:

- Which local services to digitise <i>first</i> for the **biggest** cost reduction
- How to take services digital when you have existing long term, large providers in situ
- How to change your culture and attitudes to become agile in a non-agile organisation<br/>
<br/>

# Who is this event for?

This event is for heads of digital, heads of IT, project managers, service owners, transformation managers and finance leaders in local government, including councils.<br/>
