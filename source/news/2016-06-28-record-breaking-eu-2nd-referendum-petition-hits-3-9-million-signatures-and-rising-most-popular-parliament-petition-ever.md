[Built in partnership with GDS,](https://unboxed.co/project-stories/petitions/) (Government Digital Service), Petitions enables members of the public to create or sign petitions that ask for a change to the law or to government policy. Petitions that receive 10,000 signatures get a response from the government, and those that receive 100,000 signatures are considered for debate in Parliament.<br/>

Following the EU referendum result, this [petition was started by a ‚ÄòLeave‚Äô campaigner who anticipated a ‚ÄòRemain‚Äô result](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/petition-calling-for-second-eu-referendum-was-created-by-a-leave/) but later adopted by ‚ÄòRemain‚Äô voters, and received over 2.5 million signatures over the weekend. It has now crossed the 3.9 million mark, with more signatures being added all the time. 

A statement has been released by the Petitions Committee regarding the concern of invalid signatures in the system:<br/>

<i>‚ÄúThe response to this petition has been bigger than anything we‚Äôve ever seen before. Originally designed to process 12,000 signatures per hour, the system peaked at over 150,000 signatures per hour on Saturday - a record we couldn‚Äôt even have imagined. Thanks to AWS, we were able to scale the system to handle this huge number of requests.‚Äù</i> - <b>Andrew White, CTO & Rails Core Team Member, Unboxed</b><br/>

Helen Jones MP, The Chair of the House of Commons Procedure Committee, has confirmed the Petitions Committee will consider the petition at its meeting next week and decide whether to schedule a debate on it.<br/>
